# Assembling of new genomes and collection of publicly available genomes

## New sequenced and assembled *Rickettsia* genomes

Eight metagenomes from specific tick organs were sequenced... **POUR MARIE**



## Genomes from public database

All the accession numbers of publicly available genomes analyzed in this study are listed in **Table S1** and retrievable on Genbank (<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/genome/>), except few of them only available on publication supplementaries (<https://10.1093/sysbio/syv084>, <https://10.7717/peerj.5486>). `.fasta` files were retrieved for each genome and annotated with Prokka.
