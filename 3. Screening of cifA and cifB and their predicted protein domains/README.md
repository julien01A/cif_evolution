# Screening of *cifA* and *cifB* and their predicted protein domain 

## *CifA* and *CifB* detection using specific queries

The final *cifA* and *cifB* sequences from types I to XI analyzed in this study are provided in the `cifA-cifB_sequences` directory of this GitHub section. Using these sequences as queries (separately: *cifA*, then *cifB*), `.faa` files of the bacterial genomes can be compared using `OrthoFinder v2.5.4` (<https://github.com/davidemms/OrthoFinder>, doi: <https://10.1186/s13059-019-1832-y>) with the `blast` option. 

As this step can be resource-intensive, we typically processed a maximum of 50 genomes per analysis:

```
orthofinder -f ./OrthoFinder_genomes/ -t 4 -S blast 
```
where `OrthoFinder_genomes` is a directory containing the corresponding `.faa` files generated by Prokka and the *cifA* or *cifB* query sequences.

Each OrthoFinder analysis outputs a tabular `Orthogroups.tsv` file indicating the protein(s) in each genome that match the query sequences (grouped within the same "orthogroup"). To distinguish true from false positives, all proteins from the relevant *cifA* or *cifB* orthogroups were independently aligned using MAFFT (v7.505, doi: <https://10.1093/molbev/mst010>) via the EMBL-EBI web platform (<https://www.ebi.ac.uk/>). This platform clusters highly aligned protein sequences into coherent groups, facilitating the discrimination between true and false positives relative to the *cifA* or *cifB* queries.

Once a protein from genomes confidently matches a *cifA* query (true positive), the downstream protein usually also aligns perfectly with a *cifB*, thereby enhancing the reliability of the detection of a novel *cifA-cifB* operon.


## Protein domain prediction

The final predicted protein domains of all *cifA* and *cifB* sequences identified in this study are provided in the `Predicted_protein_domains_databases` directory of this GitHub section. The corresponding abbreviations are listed in Supplementary S2 Table. Detailed domain coordinates (in amino acids) for each *cifA* and *cifB* sequence are provided in the `cifA_cifB.xlsx`, `cifA.txt`, and `cifB.txt` files available in part.5 of this GitHub repository.
This protein domain database can now be used to identify the presence of specific domains in newly predicted *cifA* or *cifB* sequences, and may also serve as a reference for gene identification (*e.g.*, through the construction of custom HMM profiles).

For all newly identified *cifA* and *cifB* sequences, we used two complementary approaches:
(i) HHpred webserver (<https://toolkit.tuebingen.mpg.de/tools/hhpred>, doi: <https://10.1093/nar/gki408>) with default parameters, querying the SCOPe70 (v2.08), Pfam-A (v37.0), SMART (v6.0), and COG/KOG (v1.0) databases.
(ii) Specific domain alignments using the database progressively built over the course of the study. The initial versions of this domain database were composed of *Wolbachia* *cif* domain sequences from Martinez et al. (DOI: <https://10.1093/molbev/msaa209>) and Gerth et al. (doi: <https://10.1099/mgen.0.000503>).

The specific alignments were performed using `Clustal Omega v1.2.2` (doi: <https://doi.org/10.1002/pro.3290>), implemented within `UGENE v52.0` (<https://ugene.net/>, doi: <https://10.1093/bioinformatics/bts091>).
