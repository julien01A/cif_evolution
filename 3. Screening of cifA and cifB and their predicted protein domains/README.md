# Scrrening of *cifA* and *cifB* and their predicted protein domain 

## *CifA* and *CifB* detection using specific queries

The final *cifA* and *cifB* sequences from types I to XI analyzed in this study are provided in the `cifA-cifB_sequences` directory of this GitHub section. Using these sequences as queries (separately: *cifA*, then *cifB*), `.faa` files of the bacterial genomes can be compared using `OrthoFinder v2.5.4` (<https://github.com/davidemms/OrthoFinder>, DOI: <https://10.1186/s13059-019-1832-y>) with the `blast` option. 

As this step can be resource-intensive, we typically processed a maximum of 50 genomes per analysis:

```
orthofinder -f ./OrthoFinder_genomes/ -t 4 -S blast 
```
where `OrthoFinder_genomes` is a directory containing the corresponding `.faa` files generated by Prokka and the *cifA* or *cifB* query sequences.

Each OrthoFinder analysis outputs a tabular `Orthogroups.tsv` file indicating the protein(s) in each genome that match the query sequences (grouped within the same "orthogroup"). To distinguish true from false positives, all proteins from the relevant *cifA* or *cifB* orthogroups were independently aligned using MAFFT (v7.505, DOI: <https://10.1093/molbev/mst010>) via the EMBL-EBI web platform (<https://www.ebi.ac.uk/>). This platform clusters highly aligned protein sequences into coherent groups, facilitating the discrimination between true and false positives relative to the *cifA* or *cifB* queries.

Once a protein from genomes confidently matches a *cifA* query (true positive), the downstream protein usually also aligns perfectly with a *cifB*, thereby enhancing the reliability of the detection of a novel *cifA-cifB* operon.
